* Cell Image Super Resolution Recovery Introduction

** In the folder ELM_SR
*** Use the ELM algorithm to complete the cell image super resolution recovery
*** How to use
**** Run the script ELM.m, then choose the first picture in HF-32 folder, finally choose the first picture in AC8-int folder. This is used to train the model. Finally it can turn the low resolution image in ac_8 pictures to ac_32 high resolution pictures. 

** In the folder SRCNN
*** It uses the CNN algorithm to complete the image recovery
**** The model has been already trained (which is providded by the mat file), I use a low resolution image for test.
**** More information can be get from the Reademe.txt

** In the folder ELM_CNN_COMPARE
*** Make a comparision between the CNN and ELM (ELM_VS_CNN.m). Also choose the first picture in HF-32 firstly, then choose the first picture in AC8-int to train the ELM model.
